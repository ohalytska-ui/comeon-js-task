# Comeon JS Task

## Getting Started

First, install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm i
```

Second, install server dependencies

```bash
cd ../
cd server
npm i
```

Finally, run the application 

```bash
cd ../client
npm start
```

I've created small server with Node.js Express and client with React
